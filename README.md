# Analyses of psychological outcomes during the COVID pandemic 

The Early Life Stress (ELS) Study follows a community sample of adolescents measuring a host of psychobiological variables.

This repo contains the code for analysing the data collected during the COVID pandemic and examining the relationship between these and prior measures collected in the ELS Study.

The raw data and basic scripts are housed on BOX (accessed reserved to the lab).  

Everyone in the SNAP lab is invited to download the codes for their own analysis, propose changes and add their own scripts.

Further project coordination info can be found by lab members on the google spreadsheet:
